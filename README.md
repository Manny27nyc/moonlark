Lua binding for [Sealark](https://github.com/obazl/sealark) - Starlark parser

Development of Moonlark has been put on hold until [Sunlark](https://github.com/obazl/sunlark) development is complete.

[The code is currently in disarray; sealark (formerly libstarlark) has changed substantially and moonlark has not kept up. That said, the code should still work once it undergoes a little reorganization. This is not a priority atm but if you really need the Lua binding please file an issue.]
